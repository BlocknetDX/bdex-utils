- The code uses randomness to generate various groups of data and scenarios and mix them together (valid, invalid, out-of-bounds data).
So the longer the tests are run, the better.

- It is therefore **strongly** advised to run these tests continuously for days to let the program generate very high number of combinations of scenarios.

- It would also be advisable to run them on a periodic basis. Because the newly run tests will *always* be different from the previous ones (due to the randomness nature).

- Randomness is used for the following variables:
  - call order in the sequence.
  - size of parameters sent to the API.
  - content type.
  - valid / invalid nature of parameter.
